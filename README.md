# Banking-Mobile-Project
This investment calculator program is designed to help users make informed decisions about their investments. The program prompts the user to input their initial investment amount, monthly deposit, annual interest rate, and number of years, and then validates the input to ensure it is within the expected range. It then calculates and displays two types of reports: year-end balances and earned interest without monthly deposits, and year-end balances and earned interest with monthly deposits. The program repeats this process until the user chooses to exit, allowing them to test different investment scenarios and compare the results. By providing a comprehensive and user-friendly investment calculator, this program helps users to better understand their investment options and make more informed decisions about their financialÂ future.
